## Description

The goal here is to analyse the given dataset to determine whether some models can be established for purposes of prediction:
- The first two examples will harness simple tools for numerical and class predictions, by determining which relationship influences house prices for the first one and which influences the possibility of the bank's subscribing to the term deposit in the second one.
- The third one will try to compare the results achieved through a stepwise regression with biderectional elimination against those of a personally chosen effective logistic regression. In both cases, the aim is to determine the relationship that best predicts whether or not a user has subscribed to the term deposit.
- The fourth one will try to find whether there is or not a trend in the given data. In particular, the variable that seems to be most interesting to predict is the amount of calories based on the other attributes.


## Installation

The examples require [R](https://cran.rstudio.com/) and [RStudio](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/) to run, and a series of packages that will be suggested by RStudio when the rmd files are first opened.

## Usage

The outputs are produced as html files, which are already included in the repo. If you need to run the markdowns select the Knit to HTML option (or the more suitable for you).

## Contribution

Any contribution with further examples or improvements are welcome.
