# trend-analysis
The goal here is to analyse the given dataset to determine whether some models can be established for purposes of prediction:
- The first two examples will harness simple tools for numerical and class predictions.
- The third one will try to compare the results achieved through a stepwise regression with biderectional elimination against those of a personally chosen effective logistic regression.
- The fourth one will try to

# MODIFY the points to include the determined variables for first and third tasks, and that you found calories to be the most interesting variable to predict in the fourth example.
